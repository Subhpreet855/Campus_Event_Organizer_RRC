#  Project Overview  

The CAMPUS EVENT ORGANIZER- RRC is a React + TypeScript web app built for Red River College Polytechnic students.  

Its goal is to make campus life easier by bringing all event information into one place. Instead of relying on posters, emails, or word of mouth, students can use this app to quickly:  

- Find upcoming academic, social, and cultural events . 
- View event details like time, location, and description.  
- Keep track of events they are interested in.
- Stay connected and engaged with the college community.

##  Why We are Building This  

This project is part of our course work, and we are building it together as a team using Agile practices.  
We are working in sprints, sharing tasks, and learning how to plan, design, and code as if we were on a real-world software project.  
Our focus is not only on creating a useful app, but also on gaining practical experience with modern web development tools and teamwork.

## Branching Strategy

- **main** - Production branch .  
- **development** - Development branch (active sprint work, no direct pushes).  
- **feature/Student-name** - Each issue or task is developed in its own branch, then merged via Pull Request.  

We are following a GitHub Flow with protected branches and ruleset for the branches.

 **Branch Rules:**  
- No direct pushes to `main` or `develop`.  
- All merges must go through a Pull Request.  
- Pull Requests must be approved by at least one team member.
